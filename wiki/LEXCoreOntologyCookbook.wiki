#summary Modeling resources in the legal domain with the LEX Core ontology.

= The LEX Core Ontology Cookbook =

The cookbook shows how to model resources in the legal domain with the LEX Core Ontology and related RDF vocabularies and ontologies. It covers the basic resources types that may be encountered in data describing this domain.

LEX Core Ontology is intended for modeling legal documents, their internal structure, changes in legal documents, and versions of legal documents which are results of these changes. Throughout the cookbook we will use a set of real examples of legal documents.

== Prefixes ==

We use the following prefixes in the cookbook:

{{{
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix frbr: <http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#> .
@prefix lex: <http://purl.org/lex/ontology> .
}}}

Prefix `lex:` is for this ontology, i.e. LEX Core Ontology.
