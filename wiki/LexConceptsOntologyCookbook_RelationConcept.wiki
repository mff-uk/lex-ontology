#summary A cookbook entry for modelling relations among concepts extracted from legal documents.

= Cookbook: Legal Relation among Concepts =

== Resource types ==

  * `lexc:RelationConcept`
  * `lexc:RelationConceptVersion`
  * `lexc:MetaRelationConcept`

== Description ==

Besides concepts, a legal document also defines relationships among concepts. A relation is similar to a concept. It is defined by an act and there exists one or more version of the relation defined by particular versions of the act. A relation is represented as an instance of class `lexc:RelationConcept`. A relation version is represented as an instance of class `lexc:RelationConceptVersion`.

Similarly to `lexc:Concept` and `lexc:ConceptVersion`, classes `lexc:RelationConcept` and `lexc:RelationConceptVersion` are subclasses of `skos:Concept`.

=== Legal Relations HTTP URI patterns and metadata ===

The HTTP URI pattern for a concept defined by an act has the following form:

{{{<ACT-URI>/relation/<RELATION-LABEL>}}}

where
  
  * `<ACT-URI>` is the HTTP URI of the act which defines the concept,
  * `<CONCEPT-LABEL>` are hyphen-delimited words from the label of the concept.
