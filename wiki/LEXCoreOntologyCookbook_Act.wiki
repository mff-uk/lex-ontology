== Description ==

`lex:Act` is a class for describing an act as an item of legislation. The act is an abstract entity which does not have any content on its own. Each act is represented as an instance of `lex:Act` class. It is a resource with own unique HTTP URI.

For HTTP URIs of acts issued in Czech Republic, we use the following HTTP URI scheme:

{{{http://linked.opendata.cz/resource/legislation/cz/act/[YEAR]/[NUMBER]-[YEAR]}}}

where

  * \[YEAR\] is the year of issue of the act in the code of laws
  * [NUMBER] is the number assigned to the act in the code of law. It is unique in the [YEAR]

Here is an example of the resource representing the Public Sector Information Act of Czech Republic

{{{
  <http://linked.opendata.cz/resource/legislation/cz/act/1999/106-1999>
    a lex:Act .
}}}


It has one or more versions. The content of the act can be found in these versions. Each particular version is represented as an instance of class `frbr:Work`.
