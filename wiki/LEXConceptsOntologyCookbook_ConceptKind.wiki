  * `lexc:ConceptKind`

== Description ==

Legal concepts extracted from legal documents in a given domain can be grouped according to more general kinds. For example, in the accounting domain, it is meaningful to distinguish concepts which are accounting documents from concepts which are accounting methods or concepts which denote accounting periods. It is not possible to define those kinds a priory. They have meaning only in a certain domain and can evolve in time. Therefore, we do not predefine them in the ontology. Instead, we represent them as generic SKOS concepts. Anyone can define own SKOS concept scheme with own kinds of concepts. We introduce a property `lexs:hasKind` which enables to associate a given legal concept with a generic SKOS concept which denotes a generic kind of the legal concept.
